# Script for populating the database. You can run it as:

#     mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs

# Inside the script, you can read and write to any of your

#
#     Deusexlog.Repo.insert!(%Deusexlog.SomeSchema{})
#
# We recommend using the bang functions (`insert!`, `update!`
# and so on) as they will fail if something goes wrong.

  bio: "<p>My first computer was a Commodore 64 and it was my grandfather that taught me how to use it. He used to make Mad Libs programs for me so that I could learn to read. I tried and built some simple Mad Libs programs back then. Ever since 1984 I have been on and using computers. After the Commodore 64 my parents bought an x86 Gateway in 1992, and in 1994 I got my first computer, a self built 486. I tried to teach myself the basic programming language but never did anything with it. Fast forward to 2012 and I got my first IT job as a Help Desk Technician/Network Admin. I did it all from A to Z, help desk, network configuration website design and consulting. I learned a lot from that experience. After that I ended up getting into PowerShell scripting and that led to my first programming job. Where I became a full stack developer using:</p><ul><li>.NET Framework</li><li>C#</li><li>Microsoft SQL Server</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li></ul>"

C# is a powerful and robust language but felt like I needed to get more breath of experience so as not to be pinned down to one technology stack. I have known for a long time that I needed to build a professional page to show off my skills to post my experiences and what I have learned to blogs and online in general. So I have stated a new project just for that. This blog is built on Elixir and the Phoenix framework.",
